# Project Description 

My Ai Playground is a Streamlit web application designed to provide users with access to a variety of AI models through APIs. With support for Chat GPT and Whisper combined to talk to ChatGPT with your own voice, and plans to add DALLE, Stable Diffusion, and Whisper with its own page in the following days and weeks. The app is an ongoing project aimed at expanding the functionality of the application to allow for more complex interactions with the models and also allow non tech folks to use them all in one.
